# GMM
This project demonstrates how to generate synthetic data using Gaussian blobs, visualize it in 2D space, and apply Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering. The goal is to understand how probabilistic clustering works and how GMM can identify underlying data distributions with different variances.
